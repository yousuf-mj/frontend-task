# Fullstack technical test (frontend)
### This test will be between 45-60 mins

This aim of this assignment is to create a frontend, that displays a list of cards containing job adverts.
There is an additional repo called [bravo-technical-test-backend](https://github.totaljobsgroup.com/OrlandoBrown/bravo-technical-test-backend) 
which provides one endpoint `http://localhost:5002/api/v1/jobs`. 
To review what the jobs listing will look like please [click here](https://github.totaljobsgroup.com/OrlandoBrown/bravo-technical-test-backend) for an example of the payload.

**Note:** You also need to clone [the backend](https://github.totaljobsgroup.com/OrlandoBrown/bravo-technical-test-backend) and run this application locally.

### For inspiration on design and layout you can use this:

It does not need exactly like this, you can also do you own design if that is better for you.

## Extra bonus points:
Add a link to the the job title where the link takes the user to a job details page

**Note:** Do not make a new page, concentrate on the backend and make a new endpoint to support the eventual response the new page would consume
