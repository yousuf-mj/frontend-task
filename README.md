# Fullstack technical test

This aim of this assignment is to create a list of jobs by calling an endpoint http://localhost:5002/api/v1/jobs
for a job listing see https://github.com/Trufa-me/bravo-technical-test-backend/blob/master/README.md for an example of the payload

You also need to clone https://github.com/Trufa-me/bravo-technical-test-backend and run this application locally.

For inspiration on design and layout please use https://github.com/Trufa-me/bravo-technical-test-frontend/blob/master/designs/layout.png
it does not need to accurate nor perfect, you can also do you own design if that is better for you.
